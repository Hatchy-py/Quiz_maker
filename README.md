# Quiz Maker

This is a simple Python class that allows you to create and run quizzes. It provides methods for adding questions, options, and answers, and allows users to participate in the quiz by answering the questions and providing feedback on their performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `quiz.py` file.

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This code is compatible with Python 3.

## Usage

1. Import the `Quiz` class into your Python script or interactive Python environment.

```python
from quiz import Quiz
```

2. Create an instance of the `Quiz` class, providing a name for your quiz.

```python
my_quiz = Quiz("My Quiz")
```

3. Add questions to your quiz using the `add_question` method. Each question should include the question itself, a list of options, and the index of the correct answer.

```python
my_quiz.add_question("What is the capital of France?", ["Paris", "London", "Berlin"], 1)
```

4. Run the quiz using the `run_quiz` method. This will display each question, prompt the user for their answer, and provide feedback on their performance.

```python
my_quiz.run_quiz()
```

5. After the quiz is completed, the user's score and the total number of questions will be displayed.

## Example

Here's an example usage of the quiz maker:

```python
from quiz import Quiz

# Create a quiz
my_quiz = Quiz("Geography Quiz")

# Add questions
my_quiz.add_question("What is the capital of France?", ["Paris", "London", "Berlin"], 1)
my_quiz.add_question("What is the largest continent?", ["Africa", "Asia", "Europe"], 2)

# Run the quiz
my_quiz.run_quiz()
```
